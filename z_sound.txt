After i Cloned the repo:
git clone https://github.com/zevv/bucklespring && cd ./bucklespring/

then i need to have some dependencies packages,

sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev libalure-dev libxtst-dev
sudo apt-get install libinput-dev

make libinput=1

after i run this upper command it would change the structer the of the repo i cloned.
and then i need to run below to run the sound 

sudo -E -g input -u $(whoami) ./buckle
This will stop on close the terminal app,

nohup sudo -E -g input -u $(whoami) ./buckle > /dev/null 2>&1 &
Then it will run on the machine even i close this terminal app.
